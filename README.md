# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analytics-Mini-Project (In Progress)

## Introduction
This project is a mini project that aims to analyze the sales data of Amazon. The dataset used in this project is a sample dataset that contains the sales data of Amazon from 2003 to 2005 from this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulvino/amazon-sales-data-analysis-project1/data). The dataset contains the following columns: 
- Region
- Country
- Item Type
- Sales Channel
- Order Priority
- Order Date
- Order ID
- Ship Date
- Units Sold
- Unit Price
- Unit Cost
- Total Revenue
- Total Cost
- Total Profit

The project aims to answer the following questions:
1. Which region has the highest total revenue?
2. What is the average unit price and unit cost for each item type?
3. Which country has the highest total profit?
4. How does the sales channel affect the order priority distribution?
5. Which regions generate the highest and lowest total profits?
6. What are the top 5 countries in terms of total revenue?
7. Which item type contributes most to total profit across all regions?
8. How does the sales channel (Online vs. Offline) impact total profit in Africa and Europe?
9. Is there a significant difference in profits based on order priority levels (e.g., High vs. Low)?
10. Is there a correlation between units sold and total profit?
11. Which item types have the highest profit margins (profit as a percentage of revenue)?
12. How do unit prices vary across different regions?
13. Which regions and product types have the highest profit margins, and how does this vary across order priorities?
14. Using a machine learning model, can we predict the most profitable combination of country, item type, and sales channel, given the number of units sold and unit prices? (In Progress)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Pyarrow
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn (Scikit-learn)

## To run the project
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have pip installed and are running Python 3.9.x to 3.12.x version
3. Install the required libraries using the following command:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt if on Windows 11
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt if on MacOS or Linux
        ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook using your Python interpreter as the kernel
5. Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis of the Amazon Sales Data
6. The results of the analysis will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Amazon Sales Data has provided insights into the sales data of Amazon from 2003 to 2005. The analysis has answered the questions posed at the beginning of the project and has provided valuable insights into the sales data of Amazon. The analysis has shown the regions with the highest total revenue, the average unit price and unit cost for each item type, the countries with the highest total profit, the impact of sales channel on order priority distribution, the regions with the highest and lowest total profits, the top 5 countries in terms of total revenue, the item type that contributes most to total profit across all regions, the impact of sales channel on total profit in Africa and Europe, the difference in profits based on order priority levels, the correlation between units sold and total profit, the item types with the highest profit margins, and the variation of unit prices across different regions. The analysis has provided valuable insights into the sales data of Amazon and has helped in understanding the factors that affect the total revenue and profit of Amazon.
